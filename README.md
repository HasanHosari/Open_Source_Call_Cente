# Open_Source_Call_Center

Corporate Environment Management & Lab Call Center Guide üñ•Ô∏èüìû

Overview

This project is a comprehensive guide for setting up and managing two distinct environments: a corporate infrastructure using Windows Server 2022, MECM/SCCM, and open-source tools, as well as a cost-effective call center using open-source solutions. The objective is to provide a blueprint that allows organizations to efficiently manage user accounts, deploy software, secure networks, and operate a scalable call center environment without incurring significant software licensing costs.

Introduction

This documentation outlines the steps taken to build a corporate IT infrastructure and a cost-effective, scalable call center. The corporate environment focuses on managing user accounts, deploying software, and maintaining a secure network, while the call center uses open-source tools to manage VoIP telephony, predictive dialing, and CRM integration.

Both setups are designed to streamline operations, reduce costs, and provide a scalable infrastructure that can be customized for various business sizes.
Corporate Environment Setup
1. Windows Server 2022 - Domain Controller

Purpose: Centralizes management of user accounts, authentication, and email services. It handles security policies, user permissions, and network resource access.
Configuration Steps:

    Install Windows Server 2022:
        Set static IP addresses and configure local/public DNS.
        Rename servers and clients for consistency.
    Install Active Directory and configure Directory Domain Services.
    Join Windows Clients to the Domain Controller for centralized management.
    Group Policy Security:
        Apply a PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration) script for a secure, locked-down environment.
    MS Office 365 & Exchange:
        Set up Office 365 accounts and configure MS Exchange Server 2019 with IMAP and POP services.
        Follow prerequisites here.
    Network Shares:
        Secure network shares and restrict file extensions using File Server Resource Manager (FSRM).
        Map network shares with automated batch scripts.

2. Windows Server 2022 - MECM/SCCM

Purpose: Handles software deployment, patch management, inventory control, and remote desktop configuration.
Configuration Steps:

    Software Deployment & Inventory:
        Use tools like PDQ Deploy or ManageEngine Endpoint Central for software management.
    MECM/SCCM Setup:
        Automate patch management and RDP setup.
        Configure the Configuration Manager Console.
    Microsoft Volume Licensing:
        Choose the appropriate activation method (KMS, MAK, or ADBA).
        Automate the licensing process using PowerShell scripts or VAMT.
    Windows Imaging & Deployment:
        Configure DHCP for IP scope management.
        Install Windows Deployment Services (WDS) for creating reference images.

Call Center Setup
3. Ubuntu 22.04 Web Server

Purpose: Hosts web applications essential for call center operations.
Configuration Steps:

    Install the LAMP/LEMP stack and Docker with Portainer.
    Use Docker containers to manage various web applications, such as CRMs or customer portals.

4. FreePBX 16

Purpose: Manages VoIP telephony, routing calls, IVR, and call recording.
Configuration Steps:

    Install FreePBX:
        Set up and configure the FreePBX GUI for managing VoIP services.
        Follow the official FreePBX Installation Guide.
    Configure Asterisk for call routing and VoIP management.

5. ViciBox

Purpose: Call center suite for predictive dialing, agent performance management, and call analytics.
Configuration Steps:

    Install ViciBox:
        Configure it for call center management and integration with FreePBX.
    CRM Integration:
        Integrate with open-source CRMs like SuiteCRM or Odoo ERP for customer management.

Network Configuration

    DHCP & DNS: Ensure reliable name resolution and scope IP ranges properly.
    RDP Configuration: Enable and secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for remote management.
    VoIP Setup: Configure VoIP endpoints using FreePBX and Asterisk.

Software Deployment & Patch Management

Automate software deployment and patch management using PDQ Deploy, MECM/SCCM, or ManageEngine Endpoint Central.
Volume Licensing Setup

Choose the appropriate licensing method based on your environment:

    KMS: For large organizations with many devices.
    MAK: For smaller or isolated environments.
    ADBA: For domain-joined devices in Active Directory environments.

Automate activation using PowerShell or VAMT.
Security and Compliance
Tools Used:

    ClamAV: Open-source antivirus.
    Wazuh: Security monitoring and compliance management.
    VMware Snapshots: Backup and disaster recovery.
    Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller: Enforces security policies and user authentication.
